# Forest_Run — Active Implementation TODO

This file is the active non-hardware implementation queue.

Use it as the day-to-day burn-down list for product work that still remains from the dream spec.

Rules:

- This file excludes hardware-only validation and device-proof retuning. Those stay in `docs/DEVICE_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Remove an item from this file only when it is fully implemented, integrated, and verified.
- Do not mark items done for partial wiring, placeholders, or scaffolding.
- Every tranche should ship complete, professional, deployable code for that slice.
- No half-baked stubs.
- Update affected docs before implementation work.

Completion standard for removing an item:

- the runtime behavior is fully implemented
- the authored content for that slice is present, not placeholder-only
- the affected tests/build are green
- the docs were updated to reflect the new truth

## 1. Onboarding And Session Arc

- [ ] Finish launch staging so the stand-up, ready state, and run start feel fully authored.
- [ ] Tighten the first 20–30 seconds of onboarding/readability so the early game teaches clearly without feeling sterile.
- [ ] Finish the restorative rest/failure scene so the player’s fall, pause, and recovery feel emotionally complete.
- [ ] Expand reflection range after runs so rest and Garden do not feel mechanically repetitive.
- [ ] Finish long-term sanctuary feel so startup, run, rest, and Garden read as one authored emotional loop.
- [ ] Deepen visible homecoming consequences from mood, route tier, bonds, repeated kindness, repeated harm, and peaceful-biome state.

## 3. Emotional Systems

- [ ] Expand `PersistentMemoryManager` / `SaveManager` into richer repeated-history presentation and unlock state.
- [ ] Broaden `RelationshipArcSystem` positive familiarity so live encounters feel more personally warm.
- [ ] Broaden `RelationshipArcSystem` negative consequence so disappointment, fear, caution, and tension are more specific.
- [ ] Add broader milestone rewards that feel relational, not merely numeric or cosmetic.
- [ ] Broaden `PacifistTracker` / `PacifistPresentation` world-state consequence beyond current route text and peaceful-biome signs.
- [ ] Broaden `CostumeManager` surfacing so costume unlocks matter emotionally outside the wardrobe UI.
- [ ] Finish `GhostPlayer` logic/policy so it is consistently helpful and never confusing in dense play.
- [ ] Make the world’s “opinion” of the player feel stronger and more legible across run, rest, and Garden.

- [ ] Expand `StoryFragmentSystem` biome-linked reflection coverage.
- [ ] Expand `StoryFragmentSystem` memory-page variety and unlock depth.
- [ ] Broaden `RestQuoteManager` quote pools across universal, biome, killer, route, and emotional-state contexts.
- [ ] Broaden `DialogueBubbleManager` trigger coverage and authored line variety.
- [ ] Broaden `FlavorTextManager` and `RunFlavorPresentation` coverage so ordinary-play authored voice stays rich across more situations.
- [ ] Keep all new writing brief, intimate, suggestive, restrained, and non-expository.

## 5. Bloom Completion

- [ ] Finish the final authored Bloom polish pass beyond the current stronger visual state.
- [ ] Deepen nearby-world Bloom reaction where it materially improves the power-state fantasy.
- [ ] Finish Bloom’s distinct music/SFX identity.
- [ ] Finish Bloom’s top-end power-fantasy presentation so it feels fully unforgettable.

## 6. Visual And Audio Production

## 7. Release-Ready Productization

- [ ] Prepare final store-ready art and screenshots.
- [ ] Finish packaging and publishing readiness.
- [ ] Finish release-doc cleanup once the remaining product work is actually complete.

## 8. Documentation Hygiene

- [ ] Keep touched docs and stale comments synchronized with current runtime truth.
- [ ] Remove items from this file only when they are fully complete.
- [ ] Keep `docs/TODO_MATRIX.md` as the exhaustive ledger and this file as the active queue.
